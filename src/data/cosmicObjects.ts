        note: "In a binary system the more massive star evolves faster, expanding into a subgiant or giant while the secondary is still on the main sequence. When the primary's outer envelope overflows its Roche lobe — the teardrop-shaped gravitational boundary — mass streams onto the companion, altering both stars' evolutionary tracks.",
        fact: "Algol (β Persei), the original 'demon star', is a semi-detached eclipsing binary just 90 light-years away. Its periodic dimming was understood by John Goodricke in 1783, making it the first binary explained scientifically.",

        ],
        note: "The secondary star orbits the common centre of mass (barycentre) and may be a mass gainer in a semi-detached system. Accreted material spins it up, and the influx of hydrogen-rich gas can dramatically change its surface composition and luminosity. In some systems the secondary eventually surpasses the primary in mass — a reversal called the Algol paradox.",
        fact: "The Algol paradox puzzled astronomers for decades: in Algol the less evolved star is the more massive one, seemingly violating stellar evolution theory. Mass transfer is the resolution.",

        ],
        note: "The Roche lobe is the critical equipotential surface around each star within which material is gravitationally bound to that star. Where the two lobes touch — the inner Lagrange point L1 — is the gateway for mass transfer. A detached binary has both stars well within their lobes; a semi-detached binary has one star filling its lobe; a contact binary has both stars overflowing, sharing a common envelope.",
        fact: "Édouard Roche derived the tidal radius limit in 1848, originally in the context of why moons don't aggregate too close to planets — the same mathematics governs mass transfer in binary stars.",

        ],
        note: "Gas escaping through L1 forms a narrow stream that spirals into an accretion disk around the mass-gaining star. Viscous dissipation in the disk converts gravitational potential energy to heat and light — in X-ray binaries where the accretor is a neutron star or black hole, this process is extraordinarily efficient, radiating more energy per kilogram than nuclear fusion.",
        fact: "In a Type Ia supernova scenario, a white dwarf accretes mass from a companion until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 M☉) and undergoes thermonuclear detonation — producing a 'standard candle' used to measure cosmic expansion.",
